CSS Flex:
---------
     Flex (also known as flexbox) is a layout model that provides an efficient way to distribute space between items in a container, even when their size is dynamic. It helps create responsive designs without relying heavily on float and positioning properties.

Key Features of Flexbox in CSS:
-------------------------------
  1. Flex container: The parent element that holds the items.
  2. Flex items: The child elements inside the flex container.
  3. Main axis: The primary axis along which flex items are places (Horizontal by default).
  4. Cross axis: The perpendicular axis to the main axis (vertical by default)

Note:
-----
  - flex properties will apply to direct children of the flex container
  - flex properties will not apply to nested flex containers.

Basic Syntax of Flexbox:
------------------------
    .container{
        display:flex;
    }
